## GroceryList

- Create a branch for your grocery list app.

- Set up a groceries database
- Add a table for `groceryitems` with the following columns
    - `name`
    - `quantity`

- Set up `pg-promise` to access this database

- Write queries to Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete items

- Use theses queries inside of functions

- Group these functions into their own node module.
